# DESIGN PATTERS

They are solution models for specific problems frequently found in software engineering.

They are not implemented solutions but rather templates that can be applied in various circumstances. Because of this, they become more efficient, as they can be customized for each scenario.

They are categorized into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## Creational

Focus on object creation mechanisms, providing ways to help create objects.

## Structural

Deal with object composition, describing how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures.

## Behavioral

Concerned with object interaction and responsibility distribution, focusing on how objects communicate.
